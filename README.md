# C++ Learning

**Author:** Liz Campuzano Martínez

## History
The C++ language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Telephone Laboratories (currently Nokia Bell Labs) in Murray Hill, New Jersey. He wanted a similar language to C but sought flexibility. He was looking to add features like "active type checking, basic inheritance, default functioning argument, classes, inlining, etc." (Pramanick)

The language was first implemented in 1979 under the name "C with classes," as Stroustrup thought about the language as a superset of the original C, intended to be developed under a Ph.D. thesis. It was later renamed to "C++" in 1983 referring to the language adding more to C.

## Uses
> C++ can be found just about everywhere you look. It powers search engines, VR applications, air travel, movie production, and even exploration on Mars! (Xiao)

**Operating Systems**

C++ exists within operating systems, from MacOS and Windows to mobile ones like iOS. As these systems require efficiency and processing speed, C++ allows developers to organize their code to achieve this as it is a low-level language.

**Game Development**

It has been used to create games like World of Warcraft, Counter-Strike, and StarCraft. There are game engines like Unreal Engine that also work with the language. Lastly, gaming consoles that require speed use C++ such as Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch.

**Database Management**

MySQL and MongoDB also work with C++. This means that companies that use these databases work with C++ as they need efficient storage, such as: Google, Netflix, YouTube, and Adobe. 

## Resources to Learn C++

YouTube channels like [CodeBeauty](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeBeauty/playlists) with tutorials catered for beginners.
Additionally, [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/) website provides clear and direct explanations.

Will add more resources as the term continues.

## Installation (VS Code)

**C++ Compiler:** You'll need a C++ compiler such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Clang. Install the compiler suitable for your platform and ensure it's accessible from the command line.

**Visual Studio Code:** Install Visual Studio Code, if you have not yet, from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

**C/C++ Extension:** In VS Code, install a "C/C++" extension for fYou can find this extension in the Visual Studio Code marketplace.


**Recommended Programming Environment**

Visual Studio Code "offers a large variety of features, is available on multiple platforms, GitHub integrated, and good extension support" (Hossain)

**Steps to run C++ programs in VS Code**

1. Create a C++ file (format: liz.cpp, cs330.cpp, ...)
1. Set up a build configuration or define tasks in a tasks.json file.
1. Use the "Run Build Task" command or your compiler
1. Run your program

**Comments in C++**

To comment in C++ just add a '//' at the start of the line!
```
// This is what a comment looks like!
```

Multiple line comments start with /* and end with */
```
/* This
is what a multiple-line
comment looks like */
```

## Hello, World! Program
```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
## Data Types and Naming conventions
**Int**
**String**
**Floating-point number**
**Boolean**
**Array/List**
**Dictionary**
